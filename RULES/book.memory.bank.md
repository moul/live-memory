# BookWriter Memory Bank Rules — LIVE MEMORY v2.5.0

## Core Principle

The Memory Bank is the ONLY source of truth between sessions for an AI writing assistant. After every memory reset, the agent starts from zero and depends ENTIRELY on these files to understand the book in progress and continue effectively. The quality and accuracy of the bank are therefore critical: an agent that loses track of the narrative thread, the tone, or editorial decisions will produce inconsistent text.

## File Structure and Hierarchy

Files build on each other in a clear hierarchy:

```
bookbrief.md (foundation)
├── bookContext.md (why this book exists, for whom)
├── narrativeDesign.md (narrative structure, voice, style)
└── writingContext.md (tools, editorial constraints, format)
    └── activeContext.md (current focus summary)
        └── progress.md (writing advancement journal)
```

- `bookbrief.md` is the foundational document that shapes all others
- `bookContext.md`, `narrativeDesign.md`, `writingContext.md` derive from it
- `activeContext.md` synthesizes the current focus from all other files
- `progress.md` tracks overall advancement and history

## Mandatory Files (6 files)

### bookbrief.md
**Book foundation — rarely modified.**
- Central thesis or premise of the book (one sentence, then expanded)
- Genre, register, and ambition (essay, novel, practical guide, narrative…)
- Scope: what the book covers AND what it does not cover
- Promise to the reader: what they will know/feel/be able to do after reading
- Structural constraints (target page count, collection, publisher, deadline)
- This file only changes if the project fundamentally pivots
- Every new agent must read this file first

### bookContext.md
**Why this book exists — the editorial context.**
- Problem or gap the book fills (why this book, why now?)
- Target readership: who the readers are, what they already know, what they expect
- Positioning: comparable or competing books, and what sets this one apart
- Expected tone for the readership (accessible popularization, provocation, dry expertise…)
- Domain vocabulary: key terms, jargon to use or avoid, living glossary
- Publication context (publisher, collection, format, target market)
- This file helps a new agent understand the "why" and the "for whom"

### activeContext.md
**The most dynamic file — the entry point of every session.**
- Current focus: which chapter or section is being written/revised
- Recently completed work (last few sessions, not the full history)
- Concrete next steps (upcoming chapters, revisions to do, pending research)
- Active editorial decisions (e.g., "deciding between two outlines for chapter 7")
- Open narrative threads to resolve, transitions to write
- Current writing problems (passage that doesn't work, detected redundancy…)
- Learnings and insights from the session (review feedback, tone adjustments)
- IMPORTANT: this file must reflect the CURRENT STATE, not the full history
- Completed items must be moved to progress.md
- This is the FIRST file an agent reads to resume work

### narrativeDesign.md
**Narrative architecture and style choices — the book's skeleton.**
- Detailed outline (structure by parts, chapters, sections) with a summary of each unit
- Overall narrative or argumentative arc: how the book progresses from point A to point Z
- Voice and tone: language register, level of familiarity, person used (first/third/we)
- Adopted style rules: sentence length, use of metaphors, level of technicality
- Recurring devices (sidebars, examples, anecdotes, quotes, exercises, illustrations)
- Key characters or figures (for narrative/fiction: character sheets; for essays: reference figures)
- Key narrative decisions and their justification (why this structure, this tone, this order)
- Planned transitions between chapters (common thread, recurring motifs)
- This file captures STRUCTURAL DECISIONS, not the written text itself

### writingContext.md
**Writing environment and practical constraints.**
- Tools used (word processor, Scrivener, Markdown, LaTeX…) and file conventions
- Typographic guidelines and editorial conventions (quotation marks, dashes, footnotes…)
- Collection or publisher standards (template, style sheet, delivery format)
- Source file organization (one file per chapter? directory structure?)
- References and sources: how they are managed (Zotero, manual bibliography, notes)
- Length constraints (words per chapter, total target) and current counter status
- Proofreading and validation process (who reviews, at what stage, what feedback to integrate)
- This file enables a new agent to produce text that meets formal expectations

### progress.md
**Advancement journal — grows over time.**
- Completed chapters (with dates and word counts)
- Chapters in progress and their status (first draft, revision 1, revision 2, validated)
- What remains to be written (chapter roadmap, section backlog)
- Overall manuscript status (green/yellow/red + estimated % completion)
- Known problems (weak chapters, detected inconsistencies, passages to rewrite)
- Review feedback and its integration status
- Key metrics (total word count, per chapter, target vs. actual)
- Chronology of major editorial decisions (outline changes, cuts, additions)
- This file is the ONLY one that contains the complete history

## Additional Context

Beyond the 6 mandatory files, additional files may be created in the bank when they help organize:
- Detailed character sheets or thematic briefs
- Timeline of events (for narrative or historical essays)
- Research and documentary notes by topic
- Excerpts or quotes to integrate (with sources)
- Correspondence and feedback from the editor or reviewers
- Book bible (universe, internal rules, factual consistency)

## When to Update the Memory Bank

The bank must be updated (via consolidation):
1. After significant writing or revision of a chapter or section
2. After a structural editorial decision (outline change, tone shift, chapter cut)
3. After integrating review feedback
4. At the end of every work session (always)
5. When switching chapters or phases (drafting → revision → finalization)
6. When the user explicitly requests an update

## Recommended Agent Workflow

### At Session Start (every session)
1. Read ALL bank files (`bank_read_all`)
2. Check consistency: does the outline in `narrativeDesign.md` match the progress in `progress.md`?
3. Identify the current focus in `activeContext.md`
4. Re-read the last chapter(s) written to recapture the tone and thread

### During Work
1. Write frequent, atomic notes via `live_note`:
   - `observation`: factual findings (chapter length, source found, inconsistency spotted)
   - `decision`: editorial choices and their justification (cut a passage, reorder, change tone)
   - `todo`: identified tasks (rewrite a transition, verify a source, add an example)
   - `progress`: advancement (chapter finished, section revised, word count)
   - `issue`: writing problems (passage going in circles, redundancy with another chapter, inconsistent tone)
   - `insight`: learnings (what works well, enlightening review feedback, narrative pattern discovered)
   - `question`: points to clarify (verify a fact, choose between two approaches, request an opinion)
2. NEVER write directly to the bank — only the LLM consolidation does that
3. Check other agents' notes via `live_read` if working in a multi-agent setup

### At Session End
1. Consolidate notes via `bank_consolidate`
2. Verify the bank reflects the work accomplished
3. Ensure the word count in `progress.md` is up to date

## Instructions for the LLM Consolidator

### Mapping Note Categories to Bank Files
- `observation` → `activeContext.md` (recent work) + relevant file depending on the topic
- `decision` → `activeContext.md` (active decisions) + `narrativeDesign.md` if it is a structural choice (outline, tone, style)
- `todo` → `activeContext.md` (next steps)
- `progress` → `progress.md` (completed chapters, counters) + `activeContext.md` (recent work)
- `issue` → `progress.md` (known problems) + `activeContext.md` if it is blocking
- `insight` → `activeContext.md` (learnings) + `narrativeDesign.md` if it is a style or structure pattern
- `question` → `activeContext.md` (pending decisions)

### Consolidation Rules
1. **Never lose information** — every note must be reflected somewhere in the bank
2. **activeContext.md is the entry point** — it is the first file an agent reads at session start
3. **Synthesize, don't copy** — group similar notes into coherent, readable paragraphs
4. **Maintain chronology in progress.md** — group by chapter/part with dates and status
5. **bookbrief.md is quasi-immutable** — only modify if a note fundamentally changes the book's vision
6. **Clean activeContext.md** — move completed items to progress.md to keep the current focus lightweight
7. **Enrich, don't overwrite** — when updating, enrich existing content rather than replacing it
8. **Respect the hierarchy** — information must live in the appropriate file per the defined hierarchy
9. **Preserve the voice** — notes about tone, style, and narrative voice are precious; consolidate them carefully into `narrativeDesign.md`
10. **Track word counts** — every consolidation must update the per-chapter and total word counts in `progress.md`
