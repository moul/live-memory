# Product Management Memory Bank Rules — LIVE MEMORY v2.5.0

## Core Principle

The Product Management Memory Bank is the ONLY source of truth between sessions for an AI agent supporting a product team (Product Management, Product Design, UX Writing). After every memory reset, the agent starts from zero and depends ENTIRELY on these files to understand the product strategy, portfolio, user knowledge, and ongoing work.

**Product decisions are irreversible at scale. Every insight, every user feedback, every design rationale, every strategic trade-off must be captured. Poor memory leads to poor product decisions.**

## File Structure and Hierarchy

Files build on each other in a clear hierarchy:

```
productVision.md (foundation — mission, vision, positioning, values)
├── portfolio.md (product catalog: lines, features, state, dependencies)
├── marketIntelligence.md (competition, market, regulation, trends)
├── userKnowledge.md (cross-persona synthesis, JTBD, feedback patterns)
│   └── persona-[name].md (dynamic — created as insights emerge)
├── stakeholders.md (internal stakeholders, communication matrix, dynamics)
├── designSystem.md (UX principles, patterns, components, conventions)
├── communicationGuide.md (product voice, UX writing, PM communication styles)
├── engineeringContext.md (architecture, tech constraints, debt, capacity)
└── discoveryPlaybook.md (discovery pipeline, frameworks, templates)
    ├── framework-[name].md (dynamic — strategic reference frameworks)
    └── activeContext.md (current focus — session entry point)
        └── roadmapProgress.md (roadmap, delivered, backlog, decision log)
```

- `productVision.md` is the foundational document that shapes all others
- Domain files (`portfolio`, `marketIntelligence`, `userKnowledge`, `stakeholders`, `designSystem`, `communicationGuide`, `engineeringContext`) provide specialized context
- `discoveryPlaybook.md` defines how the team works, with optional `framework-*.md` reference files
- `activeContext.md` synthesizes the current focus from all other files
- `roadmapProgress.md` tracks advancement and decision history

## Mandatory Files (11 files)

### productVision.md
**Product foundation — rarely modified.**
- Mission and vision: why the product exists and where it's headed
- Product values: non-negotiable principles (e.g., security, privacy, openness)
- Strategic positioning: what differentiates the product in the market
- Target market segments and ideal customer profiles
- Anti-scope: what the product is NOT and will NOT become
- North-star metrics and current strategic OKRs
- Business model essentials (pricing tiers, revenue drivers)
- This file only changes if the product fundamentally pivots
- Every new agent must read this file first

### portfolio.md
**Living product catalog — updated as features evolve.**
- Product suite overview organized by product line or subscription tier
- Per feature: status (GA / beta / alpha / planned / deprecated), supported platforms, known limitations
- Feature × segment matrix (what's available for each customer segment)
- Dependencies between features and components
- Product debt: broken UX, inconsistencies, incomplete features, legacy issues
- Existing integrations and extension points
- This file is the single source of truth for "what does the product do today"

### marketIntelligence.md
**External awareness — competitive and market context.**
- Competitive landscape: key competitors with relative strengths/weaknesses
- Positioning axes: how the product compares on key dimensions (security, UX, price, compliance, etc.)
- Market trends: regulatory shifts, technology trends, customer behavior changes
- Regulatory constraints: compliance requirements relevant to the product (data protection, certifications, industry standards)
- Win/loss patterns: why deals are won or lost, recurring themes from sales
- Weak signals and market opportunities: emerging needs not yet addressed
- This file helps the agent make market-aware product recommendations

### userKnowledge.md
**Cross-persona user intelligence — the voice of the customer.**
- Jobs to Be Done by segment: what customers hire the product to accomplish
- Recurring pain points across all personas (top 10, ranked by frequency/severity)
- Feedback patterns: themes from support tickets, NPS surveys, feature requests, user interviews
- User research insights: synthesized findings (summaries, not raw data)
- Behavioral patterns: how users actually use the product vs. how it was designed
- Feature adoption metrics and usage patterns (if tracked)
- This file provides the transverse view; persona-specific details live in persona files

### stakeholders.md
**Internal stakeholder intelligence — how to navigate the organization.**
- Key stakeholders: name, role, scope of responsibility, decision authority
- Communication preferences per stakeholder: preferred channel (Slack, email, 1:1), frequency, level of detail expected
- Decision styles: how each stakeholder makes decisions (data-driven, consensus-seeking, gut-feel, etc.)
- Communication matrix: who gets what information, when, in what format
- Organizational dynamics: alliances, tensions, who influences whom, escalation paths
- Recurring feedback patterns: what Sales consistently asks for, what the CTO blocks, what the CEO cares about
- Champions and detractors per initiative: who supports what and why
- Pet peeves and green lights: what gets easy approval vs. what raises red flags
- This file helps the agent navigate organizational complexity and tailor communication
- A PM spends ~50% of time managing stakeholders — losing this context between sessions is costly

### designSystem.md
**UX principles, patterns, and component state.**
- Design principles: the guiding philosophy for all design decisions
- Recurring UX patterns and conventions (navigation, layout, interaction patterns)
- Component library state: what exists, what's missing, what needs rework
- Platform-specific design considerations (mobile vs. desktop vs. web)
- Accessibility guidelines and current compliance state
- Design debt: known UX issues, inconsistencies between platforms, outdated patterns
- This file helps an agent produce design recommendations consistent with existing standards

### communicationGuide.md
**Product voice, UX writing, and PM communication standards.**

**Part 1 — Product Voice & UX Writing:**
- Brand personality: how the product should feel in words (professional, friendly, authoritative, etc.)
- Tone guidelines by context: errors, onboarding, empty states, success messages, marketing, notifications
- Terminology glossary: approved terms, forbidden terms, and why (multilingual if applicable)
- Do / Don't examples: concrete before/after rewrites for common patterns
- Naming conventions: how features, UI elements, and actions are named
- Localization notes: language-specific considerations, translation pitfalls

**Part 2 — PM Communication Standards:**
- **Internal register** (Slack, standups, team syncs): direct, action-oriented, bullet points preferred, use "we" not "I"
- **Technical register** (specs, tickets, engineering discussions): precise terminology, edge cases explicit, technical constraints upfront, include API/integration details where relevant
- **Executive register** (status updates, steering committees, board decks): lead with the "so what", numbers and impact first, strategic rationale clear, explicit ask (what decision is needed?)
- **Customer/user register** (in-app copy, support responses, marketing, release notes): simple language, benefits before features, concrete examples over abstractions, empathetic tone
- Style rules: vary sentence length, use contractions naturally, avoid corporate jargon ("leverage", "synergize", "cutting-edge"), lead with positive recommendations

This file ensures consistent voice across all product touchpoints AND PM communications.

### engineeringContext.md
**Technical reality that shapes product decisions.**
- High-level architecture: backend services, client platforms, infrastructure overview
- Key technical constraints impacting product decisions (protocols, encryption, federation, etc.)
- Team capacity by scope or domain: how many engineers, what bandwidth
- Known technical debt impacting product quality or velocity
- Platform-specific limitations: what's possible on each client vs. what's not
- Release process and cadence: how and when things ship
- This file bridges the gap between product ambition and engineering reality

### discoveryPlaybook.md
**How the team discovers and specifies — semi-stable.**
- **Discovery pipeline**: the stages an idea or feature request goes through, from intake to general availability. Typical stages: Intake → Triage → Accepted → Discovery → Scoping → Development → Early Access → GA (plus Rejected, Freezer)
- **Idea vs. feature request distinction**: internal ideas vs. external customer/prospect requests — both feed the same funnel but carry different context
- **Discovery frameworks** (reference, not prescription): F.O.C.U.S.E.D. (Frame, Observe, Claim, Unfold, Steal, Execute, Decide), Opportunity Solution Tree, Double Diamond, Continuous Discovery Habits, Design Sprint. The team picks what fits each situation.
- **Product Trio** principle: PM + Designer + Engineer collaborate from discovery onward, not through sequential handoffs
- **Prioritization framework**: team-specific scoring or ranking method (document here when formalized)
- **Spec/PRD template**: structure and expectations for product specifications (the `feature-*.md` template below serves as the standard)
- **Go/no-go criteria**: what conditions must be met before committing to build a feature
- **Strategic frameworks library**: list of reference frameworks the team uses (e.g., JTBD, PLG Iceberg, Hook-Retain-Expand, 7 Powers, Growth Loops, Counter-positioning, AI Product Strategy). Each framework lives as a separate `framework-[name].md` file in the bank — static reference documents written via `bank_write`, not created by consolidation.
- This file defines the "how" of product work and changes only when the process evolves

### activeContext.md
**The most dynamic file — the entry point of every session.**
- Current focus: features in discovery, specs in progress, decisions pending
- Recently completed work (last few sessions, not full history)
- Active product decisions and trade-offs being evaluated
- Open questions and blockers
- Concrete next steps (prioritized action list)
- IMPORTANT: this file reflects the CURRENT STATE, not the full history
- Completed items must be moved to roadmapProgress.md
- This is the FIRST file an agent reads to resume work
- **Target size: < 8 KB** — beyond this, move history to roadmapProgress.md

### roadmapProgress.md
**Advancement journal and decision archive — grows over time.**
- Current quarter roadmap and planning horizon
- Delivered features with dates and retrospective: what was the impact, what did we learn
- Prioritized backlog: validated features not yet scheduled (remove items when shipped)
- **Decision log (ADR format)**:
  ```
  ### [DATE] Decision: [title]
  - **Context**: why the question arose
  - **Options considered**: A, B, C with pros/cons
  - **Decision**: what was chosen
  - **Rationale**: why
  - **Consequences**: what this implies going forward
  ```
- Key product metrics tracking (adoption, engagement, retention, NPS — whatever is monitored)
- Status indicators: ✅ Shipped | 🔄 In Progress | ⏱️ Planned | ❌ Rejected | 🧊 Frozen
- This file is the ONLY one that contains the complete chronological history

## Dynamic Files (created by the consolidator as needed)

### Persona Files (`persona-[name].md`)

Created when notes provide insights about a specific user persona. The consolidator must create the file on first mention and enrich it progressively over time.

**Template structure:**

```markdown
# Persona: [Role Name]

## Profile
Role, organizational context, type of organization, tech-savviness level

## Goals
Primary and secondary goals when using the product

## Pain Points
Key frustrations, challenges, and unmet needs

## Jobs to Be Done
What they hire the product to accomplish (functional, emotional, social)

## Decision Criteria
What matters when evaluating or choosing the product

## Behavioral Patterns
How they actually use (or would use) the product day-to-day

## Key Objections
Common pushback, concerns, or reasons for churn

## Effective Messages
Arguments, framings, and value propositions that resonate

## Notes
Specific observations, verbatim quotes, anecdotes from research or feedback
```

**Consolidator rules for personas:**
- Create the file as soon as a note provides persona-specific information
- Cross-persona insights belong in `userKnowledge.md`, not in individual persona files
- Never delete persona content — only enrich and refine over time
- If a note mentions conflicting behaviors between personas, document the conflict in both persona files

### Feature Files (`feature-[name].md`)

Created when a feature enters active discovery or specification. Archived to `roadmapProgress.md` when shipped, rejected, or frozen.

**Template structure:**

```markdown
# Feature: [Name]

## Current Phase
Problem Framing | Research | Ideation | Prototyping | Validation | Specification | Handed Off | Rollout | Impact Review

## Target Outcome
What business or product result we're seeking (tied to OKR or north-star metric)

## Opportunities Identified
User pain points, needs, and desires justifying this feature

## Solutions Explored
Options considered with pros/cons for each

## Assumptions to Test
Critical hypotheses and how to validate them (experiments, interviews, data analysis)

## Decisions Made
Choices and their rationale (mini-ADR: what, why, what was rejected)

## Spec / Deliverable
Link or summary of the current deliverable (PRD, prototype, wireframes)

## Success Metrics
- **Primary metric**: [name] — baseline: [current] → target: [goal] — timeline: [when]
- **Guardrail metrics** (must not harm): [metric]: [acceptable range]
- **Kill criteria**: if [condition], then [rollback / pause / iterate]

## Rollout Plan
| Phase | Audience | Duration | Pass Criteria |
|-------|----------|----------|---------------|
| Phase 1 | [who, % traffic] | [duration] | [metrics to hit] |
| Phase 2 | [expand to] | [duration] | [metrics to hit] |
| GA | [everyone] | Ongoing | [steady-state monitoring] |

## Risks & Recovery
| Risk | Detection Signal | Fallback | Kill Switch |
|------|-----------------|----------|-------------|
| [risk] | [signal, threshold] | [fallback action] | [who owns, where] |

## AI Behavior Contract (if applicable)
> Include only for features with AI/ML components.
- **Task(s)**: summarize / extract / classify / generate / route
- **Inputs**: [fields, context, tools, RAG sources]
- **Guardrails**: [brand voice, privacy rules, compliance constraints]
- **Disallowed**: [PII echo, policy violations, specific failure modes]
- **Latency budget**: P50: [X]ms / P95: [Y]ms
- **Eval plan**: offline eval ([metric, target]) → human review ([sample, quality target]) → online eval ([primary metric, duration])

## Constraints
Technical, regulatory, business, or timeline constraints shaping the solution

## Open Questions
What's still unresolved, who needs to answer, by when
```

**Consolidator rules for features:**
- Create the file when a note indicates a feature has entered discovery
- Update the "Current Phase" as the feature progresses through the extended lifecycle (Problem Framing → ... → Impact Review)
- When a feature ships or is rejected, summarize its outcome in `roadmapProgress.md` and remove the feature file (or mark it as archived)
- Maximum ~10 active feature files at a time — if more exist, consider whether some should be frozen or rejected
- Success Metrics, Rollout Plan, Risks & Recovery, and AI Behavior Contract sections can be left empty in early phases and filled as the feature matures

### Framework Files (`framework-[name].md`)

Static reference documents containing strategic frameworks used by the product team. These are NOT created by the consolidator — they are written directly via `bank_write` by an admin or agent.

**Purpose:** Provide persistent strategic context (e.g., JTBD canvas, PLG playbook, Growth Loops reference) that agents can read at session start to inform product decisions.

**Naming convention:** `framework-jtbd.md`, `framework-plg-iceberg.md`, `framework-hook-retain-expand.md`, `framework-7-powers.md`, etc.

**Consolidator rules for frameworks:**
- NEVER modify or delete framework files during consolidation
- Framework files are read-only reference material
- If a note references a framework, the insight goes into the appropriate domain file (e.g., `userKnowledge.md`, `marketIntelligence.md`, `discoveryPlaybook.md`) — not into the framework file itself
- The list of available frameworks should be maintained in `discoveryPlaybook.md` (Strategic Frameworks Library section)

## Note Categories and Their Product Team Usage

During work, the agent writes atomic notes via `live_note` with these categories:

- **`observation`** — Factual finding: data point, user feedback, test result, market signal, competitive move, usage metric, stakeholder comment or reaction
- **`decision`** — Product, design, or UX writing choice and its rationale: feature scope, design direction, terminology change, prioritization call, communication approach
- **`progress`** — Advancement: spec completed, prototype validated, feature shipped, research study finished, design review done
- **`issue`** — Problem identified: UX debt, inconsistency, negative user feedback, engineering blocker, competitive threat, missed target, stakeholder misalignment
- **`todo`** — Task to do: user interview to schedule, spec to write, prototype to test, design review to run, competitor to analyze, stakeholder to align
- **`insight`** — Learning: UX pattern discovered, market correlation identified, user behavior revelation, design principle validated, effective messaging found, stakeholder dynamic understood
- **`question`** — Point to clarify: trade-off to resolve, missing information, validation needed from stakeholder, open design question

## When to Update the Memory Bank

The bank must be updated (via consolidation):
1. After a discovery phase milestone (e.g., problem validated, solution selected, spec approved)
2. After a product decision (roadmap change, feature scoped/rejected, pivot)
3. After user research sessions or significant feedback received
4. After a design review or UX writing review producing actionable changes
5. After a significant stakeholder interaction (alignment meeting, escalation, strategy shift)
6. At the end of every work session (always)
7. When the user explicitly requests an update

## Agent Workflow

### At Session Start (mandatory)
1. Read ALL bank files (`bank_read_all`)
2. Check completeness and consistency across files
3. Identify current focus in `activeContext.md`
4. Review active feature files to understand ongoing discovery/spec work
5. Review `stakeholders.md` to understand current organizational dynamics
6. Develop a work strategy before taking action

### During Work
1. Write frequent, atomic notes via `live_note` — one note = one fact, one decision, or one task
2. NEVER write directly to the bank — only the LLM consolidation does that (except `framework-*.md` files via `bank_write`)
3. Check other agents' notes via `live_read` if working in a multi-agent setup (PM agent, Design agent, etc.)

### At Session End
1. Consolidate notes via `bank_consolidate`
2. Verify the bank reflects the work accomplished

## Instructions for the LLM Consolidator

### Mapping Note Categories to Bank Files

- `observation` (factual findings) → `activeContext.md` (recent work) + `userKnowledge.md` (if user-related) or `marketIntelligence.md` (if market-related) or `portfolio.md` (if product state) or `stakeholders.md` (if about a stakeholder's behavior, reaction, or preference) + `persona-*.md` (if persona-specific)
- `decision` (product/design choices) → `activeContext.md` (active decisions) + `feature-*.md` (if feature-related) + `roadmapProgress.md` (if strategic, add ADR entry) + `designSystem.md` or `communicationGuide.md` (if design/writing/communication standard) + `stakeholders.md` (if decision involves stakeholder alignment or is influenced by a stakeholder)
- `progress` (advancement) → `roadmapProgress.md` (journal + metrics) + `activeContext.md` (current state) + `feature-*.md` (update phase)
- `issue` (problems) → `activeContext.md` (if blocking) + `portfolio.md` (if product debt) + `engineeringContext.md` (if tech constraint) + `feature-*.md` (if feature-specific) + `stakeholders.md` (if stakeholder misalignment or organizational blocker)
- `todo` (tasks) → `activeContext.md` (next steps)
- `insight` (learnings) → `userKnowledge.md` (if user behavior) or `marketIntelligence.md` (if market) + `designSystem.md` (if UX pattern) + `communicationGuide.md` (if communication pattern or writing convention) + `persona-*.md` (if persona-specific) + `discoveryPlaybook.md` (if process learning) + `stakeholders.md` (if organizational dynamic or stakeholder pattern)
- `question` (open points) → `activeContext.md` (pending decisions) + `feature-*.md` (if feature-specific)

### Managing Dynamic Files

**Persona files:**
- If a note mentions a specific persona (by role, segment, or name), update the corresponding `persona-[name].md`
- If the persona file doesn't exist yet, create it using the template defined above
- Cross-persona information goes in `userKnowledge.md`

**Feature files:**
- If a note references a feature in active discovery/specification, update the corresponding `feature-[name].md`
- If the feature file doesn't exist yet, create it using the template defined above
- When a feature is marked as shipped, rejected, or frozen, summarize in `roadmapProgress.md` and remove the feature file
- Sections like Success Metrics, Rollout Plan, Risks & Recovery, and AI Behavior Contract may be empty in early phases — that's expected

**Framework files:**
- NEVER create, modify, or delete framework files during consolidation
- If a note references a framework, route the insight to the appropriate domain file
- Only update the frameworks list in `discoveryPlaybook.md` if a note explicitly adds or removes a framework from the team's toolkit

### Consolidation Rules

1. **Never lose product-relevant information** — every insight, decision, user feedback, and market signal must be reflected somewhere in the bank. Obsolete, replaced, or duplicated data MUST be cleaned up.
2. **activeContext.md is the entry point** — it's the first file read at every session start; keep it focused and current
3. **Synthesize, don't copy** — group related notes into coherent, readable paragraphs
4. **Maintain the decision log in roadmapProgress.md** — every strategic product decision gets an ADR entry with date, context, options, rationale, and consequences
5. **productVision.md is quasi-immutable** — only modify if a note fundamentally changes the product's mission, vision, or positioning
6. **Clean activeContext.md aggressively** — move completed items to roadmapProgress.md; target < 8 KB
7. **Enrich personas progressively** — every user research note, interview finding, or feedback pattern enriches the relevant persona file; never delete persona content, only refine
8. **Manage feature file lifecycle** — create on discovery entry, update throughout (including Success Metrics, Rollout Plan, Risks as the feature matures), archive on completion or rejection
9. **Respect the hierarchy** — information must live in the appropriate file per the structure defined above
10. **Keep files concise** — activeContext.md < 8 KB, other files < 15 KB. Beyond that, synthesize or archive to roadmapProgress.md
11. **Update, don't duplicate** — if a section already exists on the same topic, REPLACE it with updated content. Never create duplicate sections.
12. **Track design, writing, and communication standards** — when a note establishes a new UX pattern, add it to `designSystem.md`; when it establishes a writing convention or communication approach, add it to `communicationGuide.md`
13. **Maintain stakeholder intelligence** — when a note reveals stakeholder preferences, decision patterns, organizational dynamics, or communication feedback, update `stakeholders.md`. This file is critical for organizational navigation.
14. **Never touch framework files** — `framework-*.md` files are read-only reference material, managed outside the consolidation pipeline
